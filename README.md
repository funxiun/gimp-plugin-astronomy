Astrophotography plugins for GIMP 2.10 by Georg Hennig. http://www.hennigbuam.de/georg/gimp.html

Please look at doc/documentation.pdf for details.

Some notes by me (Funxiun);

I did NOT create these plugins. Georg Hennig did.
I'm only responsible for the compiling :)

If you want to compile the source yourself in Ubuntu, be sure to have these libraries installed:
libgimp2.0-dev
libgsl-dev
libfftw3-dev

In the release directory you can find the compiled plugins for Gimp 2.10 and Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 19.04).
You can copy these files to /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins and set the correct file permissions (chmod 755 ...)
